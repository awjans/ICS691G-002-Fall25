The paper investigates the early adoption and effects of **GitHubâ€™s Copilot for Pull Requests (PRs)**, a tool that uses generative AI to automate PR descriptions and reviews. It aims to understand adoption trends, impacts on review processes, and how developers adapt AI-generated content. 18,256 PRs with Copilot-generated descriptions from 146 GitHub projects were compared with 54,188 PRs without Copilot assistance.

Key findings included Adoption Trends, Impact on Code Reviews, and Developer Interventions. There has been a steady increase in the early adopters since the March 2023 release. Use is a mixed bag, where some repositories use it heavily while others use it sparingly. PRs with Copilot-generated descriptions had an average review time **19.3 hours shorter**, and were more likely to be merged by the maintainers. Developers generally refine the AI-generated content rather than using it as-is.
